1. The Core PhilosophyThe app operates on a simple loop:Passive Capture: It runs in the background, noting what windows are active, what you copy/paste, and general context changes.AI Synthesis: It groups these activities logically into "Sessions" and generates a natural language summary and tags.Active Refinement: The user reviews the auto-summary in an editor and turns it into permanent knowledge.2. The Layout ArchitectureWe will use a modern two-panel layout with a persistent top navigation bar. This balances the need for browsing history (left) with focused work (right).Top Navigation Bar (Search, Settings, Profile)Left Sidebar (The Timeline)Chronological feed of auto-summarized sessions.(Standard width, scrollable)3. Feature Deep Dive & UI DesignA. The Left Sidebar: "The Activity Timeline"This is directly inspired by the Pieces screenshots you provided (image_0.png & image_1.png), but adapted for general use.Design Principles:Scannability is Key: Users must be able to glance at 20 items and find the one they need in seconds.Visual Anchors: Use app icons as primary visual anchors.Hierarchy: Clear separation between days (Today, Yesterday).The "Session Card" Component:Every card in the sidebar represents a cluster of activity (e.g., "Researching Vacation Spots" or "Writing Q3 Report").Plaintext[Date Header: Today]

The "Drill-Down" State (Inspired by image_1.png):If a user clicks a small expand arrow on a session card, it reveals the raw activities that made up that summary. This is crucial for trust—showing the user why the AI summarized it that way.Plaintext[v] **Planning Summer Vacation...** (Expanded)

 |-- [Slack]  Message to @Sarah: "Found some flight options"

B. The Main Content Area: "The Intelligent Editor"When a session card is selected in the sidebar, it opens here. This is where the Notion influence comes in. It's not just a text box; it's a block-based canvas.Initial State (Auto-Generated):When first opened, the editor contains the AI's best attempt at summarizing the session.Header: Planning Summer Vacation & BudgetingContext: 3 Apps involved (Chrome, Slack, Apple Notes) | Today, 2:00 PMAuto-Summary:You spent the last hour and a half researching travel options for Japan. You looked at flights on Google Flights and cross-referenced hotels on Tripadvisor. You then briefly communicated findings to Sarah on Slack before starting a rough draft itinerary in Apple Notes.Key Artifacts Detected:[Link: Tripadvisor - Top 10 Hotels...][Clipboard Content: "$1,200 round trip estimate"]User Action (Refinement):The user clicks into the editor. They can delete the AI summary, edit it, or add new blocks using a / command, just like Notion./heading/todo list/image/code block (yes, even non-developers use SQL or basic snippets)The goal is that the passive activity tracking turns into an active knowledge base note.C. The Search Experience: "Total Recall"This is the most critical feature you requested. It needs to be powerful and intuitive.Trigger: A prominent search bar in the top nav, or a global hotkey (e.g., Cmd+K or Ctrl+K).The Search Modal overlay:When triggered, a large modal appears in the center of the screen. It shouldn't just be a text input; it needs visual filtering controls immediately visible.UI Layout of the Search Modal:Plaintext+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

How the Filtering Works:Natural Language processing: If the user types "Zoom calls about marketing last Friday," the AI should auto-set the Date filter to last Friday and select the Zoom app icon.Manual Overrides: The user can manually click the app icons to toggle them on/off.The "Exclude" Feature: This is brilliant. Sometimes you want to find "That document I was writing when I wasn't distracted by Slack."Action: User selects the "Exclude" toggle mode. They click Slack and Discord icons.Result: The search returns activities where those apps were not active.Summary of the User ExperienceA freelance graphic designer, Alex, starts their day.They spend 3 hours jumping between Photoshop, Illustrator, Spotify, and client emails in Spark.The app runs silently.At lunch, Alex opens the app. The left sidebar has a card summarizing the morning: "Project Alpha Design Sprint & Client Comms" with icons for Ps, Ai, Spotify, and Spark.Alex clicks the card. The main editor shows an AI summary.Alex realizes they found a great reference image during that time but forgot to save it.They hit Cmd+K, type "reference image," and click the Photoshop icon filter.The search result pinpoints the exact moment they had that file open. They click it, restoring the context.Back in the editor, they use /image to paste that reference image into the note for posterity.
